# Schedule for Advanced Python SJII Coding CCA

## `1_setup` Lesson One: Python3 and Bash setup 
- (Windows) install WSL, ubuntu, bash
- Install python3
- pip3 install (bs4, json)
- VSCode install and config
- Command line
- Role of terminal in python
- What is Python?
  - Dynamically typed
  - Interpreted
- Hello World!
- Debugging

## `2_review` Lesson Two: Review of Basic Python 
- Datatypes
	- int, bool, str, float
	- Floats do not accurately represent decimals
	- 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3
- Variables
	- Assignment, usage
- Operators
	- not, and, or
	- ==, !=, in, is
- Control statements
	- if, elif, else
	- for, else
	- while
- Functions
	- Function definition
	- Paremeters vs arguments
	- Return: usage?

## `3_moreTypes` Lesson Three: More datatypes, operations, and scoping
- List, dict, sets, objects
- Data manipulation
	- Slicing, sorting, searching
	- for in loops
	- nD lists/arrays/tensors
- Ternerary operations
	- Operator specficity, not > and > or
	- Inline evaluation
	- List comprehension
	- Dictionary comprehension
- Environment scoping
	- Local vs global variables
	- Functional vs block scoping
	- Why are globals bad?

## `4_turtle` Lesson Four: Turtle
- What is a GUI?
- The turtle object
	- Methods
	- Up, left, down, right, speed, colour, thickness
- Pattern exploration
	- Self exploration
- How does GUI & turtle work?

## `5_oop` Lesson Five: Object Oriented Programming
- What does OOP mean?
	- Functional vs Object-oriented programming
	- A mess of dictionaries and functions without OOP
- Turtle review
	- Turtle is a class
	- Property methods modify class properties
- Define a class!
	- \_\_init__ called in class creation
	- \_\_str__ called when forcing to string
	- The idea of self
	- Why self solves messy dicts & funcs
	- Properties
	- Methods
- Create a class!
	- Point class

## `6_moreOop` Lesson Six: More OOP!
- Special functions (overloading)
	- \_\_specialFunc__ format
	- Use classes in operations
	- add, sub, mul, op, float, truediv, lt, gt, le, ge, eq
	- Point class with overloading
- Inheritance
	- Parent and child, abstract and concrete
	- SuperTurtle extends Turtle
	- SuperTurtle to have keybindings - improve parent
- Overriding
	- Overriding what the parent says - meaning?
	- Calling `super()`
- Many parents
	- Gets properties and methods from all parents
